This Python code implements a basic logistic regression model for binary classification using a neural network approach. Here's a summary of the key components and steps:

Data Loading and Preprocessing:
The code loads a dataset from a CSV file using a custom utility function (load_dataset_csv).
It prints information about the dataset, such as the number of training and testing examples, number of features, and the shapes of input and output data.
Data Standardization:
The input data is standardized using StandardScaler from scikit-learn separately for training and testing sets.
Sigmoid Function:
The sigmoid function is defined to calculate the activation in the neural network.
Initialization of Parameters:
Weights (w) are initialized with small random values, and bias (b) is initialized to zero.
Forward and Backward Propagation:
The propagate function computes forward and backward propagation, calculating the cost and gradients.
Optimization (Gradient Descent):
The optimize function updates the weights and bias through gradient descent to minimize the cost function.
Prediction:
The predict function uses the trained parameters to make predictions based on input data.
Model Training:
The model function combines the initialization, optimization, and prediction steps to train the logistic regression model.
Model Evaluation:
The model's accuracy is evaluated on both the training and testing sets.
Plotting Cost Evolution:
A plot of the cost function over iterations is displayed to visualize the learning progress.
Example Usage:
An example of using the model to train and make predictions on a dataset is provided.
